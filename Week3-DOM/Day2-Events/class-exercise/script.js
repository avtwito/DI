/**
 * Exercise 1 - basic addEventListener
Create two buttons - id of "red", id of "blue"
When we click on the red button -> Change the backgroundcolor of the page to red
When we click on the blue button -> Change the backgroundcolor of the page to blue

Exercise 2 - using the event object
const colors = ["blue", "yellow", "green", "pink"];

Add inside the HTML file a div of id "container" (do it directly in the HTML)
Using a loop, add one button per color inside the div container (do it directly in the JS)
Each button should have an "click" event listener that changes the background color of the document, to the color of the button (do it directly in the JS)
